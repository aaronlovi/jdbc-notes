# jdbc-notes
Some simple template JDBC code. Each method call from main.java is a template for a pattern you can use to write some JDBC. There are some simplifications in the code, just to focus on the JDBC topic at hand. For example, exception handling is over-simplified. A robust JDBC application will handle exceptions better, for example, translating SQLException to specific exceptions depending on the error code, situation, etc.
